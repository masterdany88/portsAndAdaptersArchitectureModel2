== Dev Mode Questions

=== Changes in standalone.xml don't seem to work in Dev Mode. What gives?
By default, the older JBossLauncher instance is started using a copy of `$JBOSS_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone-full.xml`
while the newer EmbeddedWildflyLauncher uses `$JBOSS_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml`.

=== How can I specify a different configuration file for Jboss/WildFly?
If you are using the older JBossLauncher, add this to your pom.xml in the `extraJvmArgs` part of the gwt-maven-plugin configuration:

-----------------------------------------
-Derrai.jboss.config.file=$CONFIG_FILE
-----------------------------------------

`$CONFIG_FILE` must be the name (*without* any parent directories) of a file in `$JBOSS_HOME/standalone/configuration`.

If you are using the newer EmbeddedWildflyLauncher, add the following to `extraJvmArgs` instead:

-----------------------------------------
-Derrai.jboss.args="-c $CONFIG_FILE"
-----------------------------------------

=== How can I pass other options to the JVM running Jboss/WildFly?
The older JBossLauncher ran WildFly in a separate JVM. To give it's JVM arguments: in your pom.xml add the following to the `extraJvmArgs`
in the gwt-maven-plugin configuration (where `$JAVA_OPTS` is the string of options):

-----------------------------------
-Derrai.jboss.javaopts=$JAVA_OPTS
-----------------------------------

For the newer EmebeddedWildflyLauncher, arguments can be passed directly through `extraJvmArgs`.

=== How do I change the port for remote debugging Jboss/WildFly?
For the older JBossLauncher, you can configure the debug port of the JVM running wildfly in your pom.xml, by adding the following to the
`extraJvmArgs` in the gwt-maven-plugin configuration (where `$PORT` is the desired port number):

------------------------------
-Derrai.jboss.debug.port=$PORT
------------------------------

With the newer EmbeddedWildflyLauncher, WildFly runs in the same JVM as the gwt compiler.

=== Can I use my own instance of Jboss/WildFly instead of the one provided?
Absolutely. If your project is based off of the erpe project, there are only two steps:
* Set the `errai.jboss.home` property at the top of the pom.xml to the absolute path of your `$WILDFLY_HOME`
* In the plugins tag in the pom.xml, remove the maven-dependency-plugin configuration
The Dev Mode launcher will now start the WildFly instance located at `$WILDFLY_HOME`.
